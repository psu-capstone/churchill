                <p><img src="./images/issues.png" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; float: right; padding-left: 1%">
                After signing in you will be shown a list of issues to weigh in on. If you see an issue that you would like to express your opinion on, just
                click on the blue bar and a poll will drop down below it. This takes us to our next step: Weighing In!</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Weighing In</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/weigh_in.png" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; float: right; padding-left: 1%">
                Once an issue has been selected, it's time to weigh in. Starting with Values(1), simply drag the values on the left, one by one, into the bucket on the right
                that best describes how you feel about it. After all the values have been assigned it's time to move on by clicking on the Objectives(2) tab. From here the process
                is repeated only this time it's objectives that are dragged from left to right. Finally we move onto the last tab, Policies(3) where we repeat the process one last time.
                Once all values, objectives and policies have been ranked it's time to click the green Submit button and move onto Interpreting Results.</p>

            <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Interpreting Results</h3>
                <p>After all the values, objectives and policies have been ranked you'll be presented with two types of visualizations of the data: a stacked bar chart each for Values, Objectives and Policies and a single Sankey diagram.</p>
                <p><img src="./images/bar_chart.png" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; float: right; padding-left: 1%"><strong>Stacked Bar Chart</strong><br>
                The first visualization is a stacked bar chart.
                Along the left side of the bar chart, depending on which tab is selected, all the values, objectives or policies are listed.
                The numbers on the bottom of the chart correspond to how many people have participated in this particular issue.
                The bars themselves are color coded according to how people felt about the value, objective or policy with a black circle indicating how you voted. For example, looking at
                the chart to the right, we can see that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>42 people in total have participated in this issue</li>
                    <li>5 people strongly disagree that Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>9 people disagree that Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>3 people have no opinion about how Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>11 people agree that Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>14 people strongly agree that Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>You strongly agree that Compassion influences your feelings on this particular issue</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><img src="./images/sankey.png" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; float: left; padding-right: 1%"><strong>Sankey Diagram</strong><br></strong>
                    The second visualization is known as a Sankey diagram. This chart shows the flow of the communities votes from Value to Objective to Policy. You will always find Values on the left, Objectives in the middle and Policies on the right. This chart may help you in determining what topics to discuss. The thickness of the line represents how strongly the community as a whole relates those two topics. The thinner the line the most likely votes were all over the place. The dark grey represents equal votes, yes -> yes and no -> no, between the items. The lighter grey represents opposite votes, yes -> no and no -> yes, between the items.

                    Some examples on how this can be read:
                    </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally people who agree with ‘Life’ also agree with ‘Restricting access to abortion’ and those who disagree with 'Life' also disagree with 'Restricting access to abortion'.</li>
                    <li>Those who agreed or disagreed with ‘Maintain access to abortions’ generally voted the opposite for ‘Eliminate federal funding to abortion-related organizations’.</li>
                    <li>The community felt strongly about the correlation of ‘Life’ and ‘Liberty’ to ‘Restrict access to abortions’ but the community did not have strong feelings about this Objective related to the Policies.</li>
                </ul>
