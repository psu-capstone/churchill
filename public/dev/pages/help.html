                <p><img src="./images/issues.png" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; float: right; padding-left: 1%">
                After signing in you will be shown a list of issues to weigh in on. If you see an issue that you would like to express your opinion on, just
                click on the blue bar and a poll will drop down below it. This takes us to our next step: Weighing In!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Weighing In</h3>
                <p><img src="./images/weigh_in.png" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; float: right; padding-left: 1%">
                Once an issue has been selected, it's time to weigh in. Starting with Values(1), simply drag the values on the left, one by one, into the bucket on the right
                that best describes how you feel about it. After all the values have been assigned it's time to move on by clicking on the Objectives(2) tab. From here the process
                is repeated only this time it's objectives that are dragged from left to right. Finally we move onto the last tab, Policies(3) where we repeat the process one last time.
                Once all values, objectives and policies have been ranked it's time to click the green Submit button and move onto Interpreting Results.</p>

            <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Interpreting Results</h3>
                <p>After all the values, objectives and policies have been ranked you'll be presented with two types of visualizations of the data: a stacked bar chart each for Values, Objectives and Policies and a single Sankey diagram.</p>
                <p><img src="./images/bar_chart.png" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; float: right; padding-left: 1%"><strong>Stacked Bar Chart</strong><br>
                The first visualization is a stacked bar chart.
                Along the left side of the bar chart, depending on which tab is selected, all the values, objectives or policies are listed.
                The numbers on the bottom of the chart correspond to how many people have participated in this particular issue.
                The bars themselves are color coded according to how people felt about the value, objective or policy with a black circle indicating how you voted. For example, looking at
                the chart to the right, we can see that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>42 people in total have participated in this issue</li>
                    <li>5 people strongly disagree that Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>9 people disagree that Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>3 people have no opinion about how Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>11 people agree that Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>14 people strongly agree that Compassion influences their feelings on this particular issue</li>
                    <li>You strongly agree that Compassion influences your feelings on this particular issue</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><img src="./images/sankey.png" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto; float: left; padding-right: 1%"><strong>Sankey Diagram</strong><br></strong>
                The second visualization is known as a Sankey diagram. It's a type of flow diagram where the width of the connection is proportional to the influence. In our Sankey diagram
                all the values are on the left, the objectives are in the middle and the policies are on the right. Using the diagram to the left we can gain some insight into the connections between
                the values, objectives and policies. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most people who value Life agree with restricting access to abortions</li>
                    <li>Few people who value Life agree with maintaining access to abortions</li>
                    <li>Very few people who agree with abolishing all abortion agree with investing in birth control education programs</li>
                </ul>
